        <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. 
        So in order to be a superhero,<b> you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess, 
        and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds.</b> Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. 
        For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story.  
        But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story.  
        If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.<br><br><em>Article on superheroes at</em> <a href="https://blog.oup.com/2018/11/stan-lee-what-is-a-superhero/">OUP blog</a></p>
